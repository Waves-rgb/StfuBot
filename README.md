# Use

To use the bot, you need jre 1.8.0_251 or higher. Head over to the releases page, and download the latest release, open your favorite terminal and type:

To get the bot to join your voice channel and start listening to people and disconnecting them, simply type `stfu!listen` into any channel the bot can see.
